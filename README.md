# Info Retriver
This Python script was generated using ChatGPT. 

The main idea with this script was to help expedite the fill out of an Excel file with a bunch of companies information that needed to be imported into a particular application/system. 

It was going to take a lot of time to do the research manually. With this script, which wasn't modified after ChatGPT provided it, it took less than 5 minutes (generation of the CSV + review of the data). 

## The prompt:
"I need a script that, given a list of company names (company_names.txt), pulls specific information from the internet about each company, to be more specific address and phone. The output should be a CSV file (company_info.csv) with the following columns: Company Name, Address 1, Address 2, City, State, Zip, Phone. You can use Google Places/Maps API to pull the information."

## Popular question:
- What if the output is not accurate? - Well, here the end-user will have to authorize that the information is accurate :)
